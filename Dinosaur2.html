                Dinosaur is a dark-ride motion-vehicle attraction at Disneyâ€™s Animal Kingdom.  The ride features a turbulent 
                journey through the late Cretaceous period, featuring prehistoric scenes populated with dinosaur audio-animatronics.  
                As guests head through the attraction, in a CTE Time Rover, they are met with lots of highly advanced animatronic 
                figures.  Most simply stand by the track, light illuminating their faces, as they move their heads to watch the vehicles 
                pass, but as the climax ensues, and guests begin a jerky trip down a hill, different types of animatronics and statues 
                line the track. Once guests are swerving around to avoid meteors near the end of the ride, up on a wall, there is a projection
                of small dinosaurs, the compsognathus, running through the underbrush.  This projection seems a little out of place, since the
                majority of the dinosaurs in the ride are animatronic figures, and these, obviously, are not.  A little known fact is that this
                projection was not always here.  Yet another animatronic figure was replaced, never to be seen again.

                When DINOSAUR opened as "Countdown to Extinction" on April 22, 1998, on opening day of Disney's Animal Kingdom, it was 
                revolutionary because of the size and complexity of the landscape, as well as the creative lighting techniques used to emmerse
                the audience.  Once of these pieces was the animatronic figures, as well as the stationary figures that pose as animatronics.
                One of the sets of the latter, a group of compsognathus appear in the ride right after going down a hill and narrowly avoiding 
                a pterodactyl.  When the ride opened, the compsognathus were not animatronics, but stationary figures that were welded to metal arms.
                The metal arms moved in a circular motion making it appear that the compsognathus were jumping around in the foliage.  This 
                effect slowly experienced wear as it was used, the hinges eventually locking up and leaving the compsognathus motionless. 
                The motionless figures then remained suspended in the air, mid-jump for years, creating a creepy effect, and diminishing 
                the exciting aspect of this portion of the ride.

            Mercifully Removed
        </h2>
        <div class="broken">
            <p>
                When Dinosaur went down for a refurbishment in preparation for its 20th Anniversery in August of 2016, many of the effects 
                inside were fixed...or at least given a more permanant replacement.  This includes the compsognathus figures.  When the ride 
                reopened in late 2016, the compsognathus figures were completely gone, replaced with projections on the two walls nearest 
                to where the metal arms once were. Now that the limp dinosaurs have been mercifully removed, the ride seems much more 
                realistic, even with simple projections replacing them. Someday in the future though, the animatronics may make a glorious 
                comeback, replacing the screens that currently seem out of place in the animatronic filled ride.

            Fixed Eventually?

            <p>
                While the current version of screens that show the compsognathus jumping through foliage seem like a pretty permanant 
                replacement for the compsognathus animatronics, maybe when DINOSAUR needs to go through an extensive refurbishment in the near 
                future all of the old effects will be returned to their previous state.  There have been no announcements thus far regarding 
                a refurbishment like this, as the last time DINOSAUR was closed for a long time was only five years ago, and the screens
                the screens were added to the experience during this refurb, but one can hope that eventually the ride will return to the 
                way it was meant to be in its early days, right after it became DINOSAUR.
