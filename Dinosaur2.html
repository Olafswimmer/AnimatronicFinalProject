                Dinosaur is a dark-ride motion-vehicle attraction at Disneyâ€™s Animal Kingdom.  The ride features a turbulent 
                journey through the late Cretaceous period, featuring prehistoric scenes populated with dinosaur audio-animatronics.  
                As guests head through the attraction, in a CTE Time Rover, they are met with lots of highly advanced animatronic 
                figures.  Most simply stand by the track, light illuminating their faces, as they move their heads to watch the vehicles 
                pass, but as the climax ensues, and guests begin a jerky trip down a hill, different types of animatronics and statues 
                line the track. Once guests are swerving around to avoid meteors near the end of the ride, up on a wall, there is a projection
                of small dinosaurs, the Compsognathus, running through the underbrush.  This projection seems a little out of place, since the
                majority of the dinosaurs in the ride are animatronic figures, and these, obviously, are not.  A little known fact is that this
                projection was not always here.  Yet another animatronic figure was replaced, never to be seen again.
