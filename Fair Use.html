        <p>
            Under Title 17 of the U.S. Code, copyright owners have the right to limit the use of their creative work. An owner has the 
            right to distribute, reproduce, display, make derivatives, or perform the work in public. This right applies to both published 
            and unpublished works fixed in a tangible medium. Creative works include:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Literature</li>
                <li>Music</li>
                <li>Motion pictures and other audiovisual productions</li>
                <li>Sound recordings</li>
                <li>Pantomimes and choreography</li>
                <li>Pictorial, graphic, and sculptures</li>
                <li>Architectural designs</li>
            </ul>

            Copyright law does not apply to ideas and facts; names, pen names, titles, or slogans; extemporaneous speeches; blank forms and 
            standardized material; and government works. Although copyright law does not protect facts and ideas, copyright protects the 
            author's phrasing or form of expression.

        <p>
            This website falls under the "research and scholarship" category of the fair use policy, and no money was (or ever will be) made from this site. 
            I did my best to give full credit to the authors of the resources I used 
            for photos and videos, but if you are the owner of a piece of material I used and would like it to be removed, contact me at 
            stevense@guilford.edu to discuss the removal of the content. Thanks :)
