              Fantasmic! is a stage show attraction at Disneyland in California and Disney's Hollywood Studios in Florida.  The show depicts 
              Mickey dreaming about a variety of different scenes from Disney movies, but he is taking part in them.  The scenes slowly 
              move toward a climax, where a 45-foot-tall dragon animatronic, meant to be Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty, tries to fight 
              Mickey and make his dream a nightmare.  The dragon spouts fire at Mickey and moves its head to watch as he turns into 
              Sorceror Mickey to fight back.  This animatronic, while impressive, frequently broke down during his early days, 
              leading to animated projections becoming a less realistic alternative. Because everything seemed to go wrong when it could, 
              this dragon was given a special nickname by fans and imagineers, Murphy.
