                An Exploration of Broken and Malfuntioning Animatronics at the Disney Theme Parks
            </h2>
            <p>
                Animatronics are a staple piece of technology at Disney's theme parks. From tiny crabs in <em>Pirates of the Carribean</em>,
                 to a 45-foot-tall dragon in <em>Fantasmic!</em>, animatronics are present in practically every Disney attraction.  But, 
                 since they are technology, all animatronics are bound to break from time to time. Most malfunctions are an easy fix, but 
                 others have such complex and expensive issues, that they remain broken to this day.
