                DINOSAUR is a dark-ride attraction, where guests ride an enhanced motion vehicle (EMV), at Disneyâ€™s Animal Kingdom.  
                The ride features a turbulent journey through the late Cretaceous period, featuring prehistoric scenes populated with dinosaur audio-animatronics.  
                As guests head through the attraction, in a CTE Time Rover, they are met with lots of highly advanced animatronic 
                figures.  Most simply stand by the track, light illuminating their faces, as they move their heads to watch the vehicles 
                pass, but as the climax ensues, and guests begin a jerky trip down a hill, different types of animatronics and statues 
                line the track.  First, right as guests head down a hill, they are met with a pterodactyl statue.  It is stationary above 
                the track, but a whooshing noise implies motion.  This is just one of the many neglected animatronics that will never move 
                correctly again in Dinosaur.

                In order to understand this malfunction, and why the effect does not work properly, guests must remember the attraction
                "Countdown to Extinction" which opened its doors on Disney's Animal Kingdoms' opening day on April 22, 1998.  The ride was much
                scarier and more thrilling than the current edition, Dinosaur.  Smaller guests were warned not to ride because the 
                ultra-realistic animatronic Carnatours, as well as the emmense jerking motion was overwhelming for younger audiences.
                COuntdown to Extinction was always planned to be converted into DINOSAUR, based on the 2000 Disney film of the same name,
                but imagineers were not planning to make changes to the ride to make it less scary for guests.  Ultimately though, changes had 
                to be made after frequent complaints of guests who ignored the signs about the intensity of the attraction, so Disney 
                imagineers had to close the attraction in May 1, 2000 to change the signage to "DINOSAUR," reprogram the Time 
                Rover vehicles to jerk less, making the ride a smoother experience, as well as make the animatronics less terrifying.
                This led to the pterodactyl animatronic that swoops down toward guests to be shut off for good.

                When Countdown to Extinction, rebranded as DINOSAUR, reopened again in late 2000, guests were surprised by the changes 
                imagineers made to make the attraction more kid-friendly.  Many animatronics were left alone, helping the ride maintain 
                a very mature setting, but the pterodactyl did not have the same fate.  When guests rode through the part of the attraction 
                where the pterodactyl was, they were faced with the same figure, but it did not move.  Some guests had the opportunity to 
                examine what was done to the metal arm that allowed the swooping motion of the figure, and it seemed that a new peice of metal 
                was added to this frame, keeping the animatronic from lowering. Eventually, as the ride began experiencing mild wear from 
                use, as well as exposure to air and moisture, the hinges of the mechanical arm seemed to have rusted, locking the joint for 
                good.  Now, the only effects in place to mimic a swooping motion of the figure include a swooping noise as the narrator 
                yells for guests to duck, and a light fixed on the figure that brightens as it "swoops forward" to catch victims who did not 
                duck.

                The pterodactyl animatronic will likely not ever be returned to its original state for three main reasons.  First, it is such a 
                small part of the ride, that many guests do not know, or care, that the animatronic is not being used in the way it was meant 
                to.  Second, the figure has a pretty convincing "B-mode" effect, with the lights and sounds, convincing most audiences that 
                the animatronic is actually swooping toward them.  Third, the entire DINOSAUR attraction would probably need to close for 
                at least a few days to remove the animatronic to fix it, and then until it was replaced (which would require another closure), 
                there would simply be no figure there at all to correspond with the narration that tells guests to duck.  So, if the animatronic 
                does ever get fixed, it would be a nice surprise for the guests that know of its fate.
