                Splash Mountain is a well-known and extremely popular flume ride at Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World.  It travels through the 
                story of Brer Rabbit leaving his home and travelling to "the Laughin' Place" and then to the Briar Patch to find a new home, 
                away from Brer Fox and Brere Bear, who try to hunt him down.  The ride features many animatronic animals with fairly complex 
                movements, including some figures that move across scenes as well as move their bodies.  One such example is a animatronic 
                of Brer Rabbit that is located in a scene where he is meant to run across a the cojntryside toward his now home, right after 
                he leaves 
                his old one.  This animatronic begins moving after a female rabbit points at him and says "there goes Brer Rabbit."  But, this 
                animatronic has had a lot of issues and malfunctions, slowly leading to a time where there is an empty field and no Brer Rabbit.

            Hopping Through a Scene

                The hopping version of Brer Rabbit was a revolutionary figure when it was created in 1992.  Since his feet don't touch the ground, the 
                programming must all be transmitted through his metal arm support, rather than him standing on the ground and having a machine 
                that gives him cues right beneath him, which was a difficult change.  The rabbit also had a large range of motion, and many 
                programmed joints, including his 
                knees, ankles, hips, and ear joints, and needed to be extremely light so that he coulf be held up in the right position.
                But, since this animatronic was a new idea, the figure was bound to experience issues. After becoming nutorious for just 
                breaking with no explanation, the hopping Brer Rabbit became known as the "million dollar rabbit" because of the emmense cost 
                of his revival each time he broke down.
                As time went on, after his introduction into the ride, he slowly began losing his large range of motion,

                </span> 
                and some of his joints 
                appeared to begin locking up. His completely limp mode became increasingly common, until one day, when the entire animatronic 
                had disappeared behind a brand new plastic shrub prob.

            Dead Bunny
        </h2>
        <div class="broken">
            <p>
                While it is admirable that maintnence gave the dead bunny animatronic some privacy with a plastic prop, it is disappointing 
                to see the animatronic disappear.  If guests turned around in their seats after they passed the scene, the rabbit could be 
                easily seen, just laying on the ground in his ready position, but never beginning the arc across the scene.  On the rare 
                occasion that he was switched on, he was no longer realistic or impressive, since most of the time the scene consisted of a 
                metal arm carrying a limp bunny across a countryside.  Often, each of the joints that had a movement function programmed 
                either went stiff, so the bunny looked possessed, or limp, so the bunny looked dead.  Neither were something that any guest 
                wanted to see, resulting in the switched off version of the bunny once again.

        <h2>
            Retheming?

        <div class="fix">
            <p>
                <span id="splash2float">
                    "the Zip-I-Dee-Doo-Dah day is coming to an end"
                </span> 
                Since Brer Rabbit has been lifeless for quite a long time now, with no mention of a fix in the future, the chances of a 
                fix to the old, or even a replacement are becoming increasingly slim.  The probability of a fix dwindled to near 0% when in 
                July of 2020, Walt Disney Imagineering released a statement regrading the retheme of the entire attraction at Walt Disney World 
                to a Princess in the Frog Bayou attraction.  While there is no news regrarding when the retheme will occur, other than the fact 
                that it will occur after Disney World's 50th anniversery in October 2021, it is still highly likely that Brer Rabbit's 
                Zip-I-Dee-Do-Dah day will end in the next few years, making a fix of the broken Brer Rabbit irrelevant.  While imagineering did 
                make a temporary fix to the figure, having the metal arm move in the correct arc to simulate hopping, the animatronic was still 
                not at 100% and quickly went back to a limp statue lying behind a shrub. This seemed like an attempt to fix him for good and 
                obviously did not work well, but one can hope that 
                before the ride closes for an extended closure to remove all the animal animatronics and become Princess and the Frog themed, 
                Brer Rabbit will be returned to his former glory, hopping through the field with a full range of motion and a smile on his face.
