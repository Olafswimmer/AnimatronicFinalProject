                Gran Fiesta Tour: Starring The Three Caballeros is a charming boat-ride attraction in the Mexico Pavilion at EPCOT. Throughout 
                the attraction, guests are faced with screens, showing the adventure of the Three Caballeros through Mexico as they prepare 
                for their Fiesta show.  The ride revolves around Panchito and Jose looking for Donald Duck, who has bailed on the show to go 
                on vacation on the beautiful Mexican beaches.  At the end of the ride, the audience gets to see the Gran Fiesta, which features 
                the Three Caballeros singing their signature song while fireworks go off above.  This ride is especially interesting because 
                it is now home to some of the oldest animatronics still in use.  The Three Caballeros animatronics were built in 1969, making 
                them 52 years old, and have been on two continents.  Unfortunately though, since the figures are now so old, they are very 
                prone to technical difficulties, and sometimes take weeks to fix.

                One incident dating back to July 2020, resulted in Jose's leg joints malfunctioning, leading him to fall facedown onstage. 
                The rest of his body twitched as he sang, since only his legs appeared to stop working.  The next day, Jose had been mercifully 
                removed from his post, and a maintence worker with a sense of humor placed marigolds in his spot as a makeshift burial for 
                the missing animatronic. Perhaps the creepiest part of this incident however,

                is the voice of Jose was still audible, making 
                him appear to be singing from beyond the grave.  After a few weeks, Jose had returned, seemingly back to normal, with new 
                feathers and paint on his face, so it seemed the scene was back to normal.

                It seemed that the animatronics were fine again after Jose's issues, but imagineers were mistaken.  In january 2021, another 
                bird begain to have similar issues to Jose.  During a ride, Donald Duck slowly began tipping sideways.  Maintence workers 
                quickly noticed and closed the ride, going in to make a temporary fix. They decided to get a large box, covered it with a 
                colorful blanket, and placed it next to Donald, allowing him to lean on it and still preform without falling over.  The next 
                day however, Donald was missing, replaced with yet another burial.  This time, there was a pot of pink flowers next to his 
                position, and where he usually stands, there was a vine holding a sombrero, as a sort of placeholder for the struggling duck.

                While Jose was returned quickly, Donald's issues were not as easily fixed. Imagineers determined there was something wrong 
                with the wiring in the stage where the animatronics perform, causing them to malfunction. To fix this, all three birds 
                needed to be removed, so much to the dismay of fans, on February 2, 2021, all three characters were replaced by character 
                cutouts.

            Back to the Gran Fiesta?

                <img id="tccutouts" src="images/TCCutouts.jpg" title="Cutout Figures Replaced the Half-Century-Old Animatronics">
                Since the issue the animatronics are facing is not too difficult or expensive to fix (as it is easily reached and is not too 
                complex of an issue), Walt Disney Imagineering released that the animatronics should be back "sometime this Spring." 
                This is a good sign for the half-century-old figures, as the issues were not so complex that it would put them out of 
                service for good.  Hopefully the employees will fix the problem soon, so the singing birds can get back to the show 
                replace to unimpressive cutout replacements.
