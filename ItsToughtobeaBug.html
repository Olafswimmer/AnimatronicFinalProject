                It's Tough to be a Bug is a 4D experience at Disney's Animal Kingdom.  It consists of an experience that requires "bug-eye" 3D 
                glasses, as well as a sort of live performance with animatronics. The show takes guests through an educational session about 
                how difficult it is for bugs in the world, so the host, Flik, brings in a lot of other memorable characters from the Pixar 
                film, <em>A Bug's Life</em> and allows them to show how helpful they are to human society, as well as why they should not 
                be exterminated.  Like usual though, the show is interrupted by Hopper, a grasshopper who believes he is above Flik, an ant 
                in the bug world.  Hopper attempts to convince Flik that humans are the root of all evil in the bug world and that they need 
                a taste of their own pesticides.  An animatronic of Flik and an animatronic of Hopper are supposed to talk back and forth, 
                Flik tying to protect guests, who he deems as "honorary bugs" from Hopper's wrath.  Of course, animatronics usually end up 
                having issues, even if they work well for years after an attraction opens.  Recently, Hopper has not made the show, his lines 
                spoken from out of view.

                Apparently Hopper, now nicknamed "Disco Hopper" by some Animal Kingdom fans, after the other nutorious broken animatronic, 
                Disco Yeti, has decided to take a little field trip away from his duties as the show's antagonist.
