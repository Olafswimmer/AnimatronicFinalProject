                Indiana Jones is a dark-ride attraction, where guests ride an enhanced motion vehicle (EMV) at Disneyland in Anaheim, 
                California.  Imagineers determined an Indiana Jones ride, where guests actually take part in the adventure, would be a 
                popular edition to the Disneyland park, especially after the popularity of the Indiana Jones: Stunt Spectacular show that takes 
                place at the then called Disney's MGM Studios (now known as Disney's Hollywood Studios) in Orlando.  For the new attraction 
                however, imagineers wanted guests to take part in the adventure, rather than just watch stuntmen escape from a temple. 
                They determined the best way to do this would be to create a vehicle that drove on flat ground, but moved passegers around, 
                a sort of simulator on wheels that drove through emmersive scenes.  One such scene was especially impressive because when a beam 
                of light shoots toward a wall, "rocks" fall into a chasm below.  Imagineers didn't want to use projections for these rocks, 
                since something real would be more emmersive for passengers.  But, within a year, the "rocks" stopped falling mysteriously 
                and the effect was turned off for good.

            Frozen Forever

                    "the machine was unreliable and rusted"
                </span>
                The rock effect was actually created using a giant ice machine, which was meant to drop dyed ice cubes onto the ground every 
                18 seconds, approximately every time a car came through the area.  The scene was designed so that the passenger-filled vehicle 
                drove across a bridge, leaving the ground level area available for the collection of the ice cubes after they fell.  Then, 
                the ice would melt and be pumped back into an ice machine installed in the roof to be refrozen in preparation for another use. 
                This seemed like an incredible plan, but when put to action, the ice machine simply couldn't keep up. Having to pump ice every 
                20 seconds for 15 hours straight every day resulted in quick deterioration of the machine.  It quickly rusted and overheated, 
                resulting in a buildup of water within, and frequent blockages.  Eventually, the ice machine only poured ice down every 3-5 
                minutes, causing 90% of guests to miss the effect.  When the machine died completely after about a year of continuous 
                operation, the effect no longer occured and was never fixed.

                Imagineers still wanted to generate some sort of scary aspect during this part of the ride, and since the machine could no 
                simulate the tunnel falling apart, there wasn't much they ccould do. Since the scene also had a sound effect that rumbled 
                each time ice was meant to fall, simulating noises of the rubble falling, they decided that this was sufficient to tell the 
                story.  Today, the rubble noises after the flash of light are all that remains of the falling rocks effect.  The ice machine 
                still remains as well, but is camoflauged up above, so many guests on the attraction do not even know that there used to be a 
                very different occurance in this part of the ride.

            A Difficult Replacement
        </h2>
        <div class="fix">
            <p>
                Some individuals who had the opportunity to see the effect in person hope that one day, the machine will be replaced and the 
                effect reimagined in a mosre sustainable way, but the problem is more complex than simply switching out the machine for a 
                duplicate. Since the effect was supposed to last forever, and the machine was not supposed to stop working, imagineers made the 
                machine a part of the cave ceiling in this part of the ride.  It is very difficult to get to without destroying the entire 
                section of the attraction, so to fix it, the ride would need to go down for an extended refurbishment time to remove the 
                entirety of the ceiling and replace the effect.  This is not a priority for imagineers, especially since if the replacement 
                occured, there is no garuntee it would work any better, so for now, guests will have to live with a flash of light, followed by 
                sound effects, instead of actual falling "rocks."
